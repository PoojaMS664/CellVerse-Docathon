Q: What is diabetes?
A: Diabetes is a chronic condition that affects how your body turns food into energy, specifically how it processes glucose (sugar) in the blood.

Q: What are the main types of diabetes?
A: The three main types are Type 1 diabetes, Type 2 diabetes, and gestational diabetes.

Q: What is Type 1 diabetes?
A: Type 1 diabetes is an autoimmune condition where the body attacks insulin-producing cells in the pancreas, leading to little or no insulin production.

Q: What is Type 2 diabetes?
A: Type 2 diabetes occurs when the body becomes resistant to insulin or doesn’t produce enough, often due to lifestyle and genetic factors.

Q: What is gestational diabetes?
A: Gestational diabetes develops during pregnancy and usually resolves after childbirth, but increases the risk of developing Type 2 diabetes later.


Q: What causes diabetes?
A: Causes vary by type but include genetics, autoimmune destruction of insulin cells, insulin resistance, and lifestyle factors.

Q: What are the risk factors for Type 2 diabetes?
A: Risk factors include obesity, physical inactivity, family history, age over 45, high blood pressure, and poor diet.

Q: Is diabetes hereditary?
A: Genetics play a role, especially in Type 2 diabetes, though lifestyle factors are also significant.

Q: Can stress cause diabetes?
A: Stress alone doesn't cause diabetes but can affect blood sugar levels and may contribute to unhealthy behaviors that increase risk.

Q: Does diet affect the risk of diabetes?
A: Yes, diets high in sugar, refined carbs, and processed foods can increase the risk of Type 2 diabetes.


Q: What are common symptoms of diabetes?
A: Increased thirst, frequent urination, fatigue, blurred vision, unexplained weight loss, and slow-healing sores.

Q: Are symptoms different in Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes?
A: Type 1 symptoms often appear suddenly and more severely, while Type 2 symptoms develop gradually and may be less noticeable.

Q: What is diabetic fatigue?
A: Diabetic fatigue is a feeling of constant tiredness caused by high or low blood sugar levels, insulin resistance, or complications.

Q: Can you have diabetes without symptoms?
A: Yes, especially in Type 2 diabetes, which can remain undiagnosed for years due to mild or absent symptoms.

Diagnosis and Testing
Q: How is diabetes diagnosed?
A: Through blood tests such as fasting blood glucose, HbA1c, or an oral glucose tolerance test.

Q: What is a normal fasting blood sugar level?
A: A normal level is below 100 mg/dL. Prediabetes is 100–125 mg/dL, and diabetes is 126 mg/dL or higher.

Q: What is the HbA1c test?
A: It measures average blood glucose over the past 2–3 months and is used to diagnose and monitor diabetes.

Q: How often should people with diabetes check their blood sugar?
A: It depends on the type and treatment plan, but many check multiple times a day.

Treatment and Management
Q: How is Type 1 diabetes treated?
A: With insulin therapy, regular blood sugar monitoring, healthy diet, and exercise.

Q: How is Type 2 diabetes managed?
A: Through lifestyle changes, oral medications, and sometimes insulin or other injectables.

Q: Can diabetes be cured?
A: There's no cure, but it can be managed effectively. Some people with Type 2 diabetes can achieve remission through weight loss and lifestyle changes.

Q: What is insulin therapy?
A: It's the use of insulin injections or pumps to control blood sugar levels, mainly used in Type 1 diabetes and some Type 2 cases.

Q: Are there pills for diabetes?
A: Yes, Type 2 diabetes is often treated with oral medications like metformin.

Prevention and Lifestyle
Q: Can diabetes be prevented?
A: Type 1 cannot, but Type 2 can often be prevented or delayed through diet, exercise, and maintaining a healthy weight.

Q: What lifestyle changes help manage diabetes?
A: Regular exercise, a balanced diet, stress management, avoiding smoking, and monitoring blood sugar.
Complications of Diabetes

A: It's nerve damage caused by prolonged high blood sugar levels, often leading to tingling, pain, or numbness.

Q: What is diabetic retinopathy?
A: It's a diabetes-related eye condition that can lead to vision loss due to damage to the blood vessels in the retina.

Q: How does diabetes affect the kidneys?
A: High blood sugar can damage the kidneys’ filtering system, leading to diabetic nephropathy or kidney failure.

Q: What are common foot problems in diabetes?
A: Ulcers, infections, nerve damage, and poor circulation, which can lead to amputation in severe cases.

Q: Can diabetes cause skin problems?
A: Yes, including bacterial infections, fungal infections, and itching.

Q: What are GLP-1 receptor agonists?
A: They are injectable drugs that mimic a hormone to increase insulin, lower appetite, and slow digestion.

Q: What are SGLT2 inhibitors?
A: These medications help the kidneys remove excess sugar from the body through urine.

Q: What are DPP-4 inhibitors?
A: These drugs help lower blood sugar by preventing the breakdown of hormones that regulate insulin.
